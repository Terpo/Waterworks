**Waterworks** is a mod for Minecraft that adds serveral water collecting mechanics.

Water mechanics in Minecraft were always quite boring, because it is simply infinite. <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/finite-water-control">Finite Water Control</a> and <a href="https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/infinitefluids">Infinite Fluids</a> add a way to get finite water. Waterworks works with both options but for the optimal experience, you should activate finite water. 

Short overview of the current mechanics:

***Raintank***
Early game rain collection block with a small inventory for water and automating.

***Multiblock Raintank***
This collection will need some more materials and comes as an multiblock. 
It will generate water a bit more quickly and uses the connected collectors as multiplier.
The shape of your structure is on your side but there is configurable maximum range from the controller block.

***Groundwater Pump***
This pump need clear sight to bedrock, to get the water from beneath.
It will make use of forge energy for each pump operation.

***Rain Rocket***
Craft some ghast tears with a Minecraft <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Firework_Rocket">firework rocket</a> to get your own rain rocket.
Values for maximum ghast tear multiplier and rain duration are configurable.

***Anti Rain Rocket***
Craft some sponges with a Minecraft <a href="http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Firework_Rocket">firework rocket</a> to get your own anti rain rocket.
Values for maximum sponge multiplier and clear sky duration are configurable.
This rocket drops wet sponges after usage.
