**Waterworks** is a mod for Minecraft that adds serveral water collecting mechanics.

Water mechanics in Minecraft were always quite boring, because it is simply infinite. 
CodeChickenCore added a way to get finite water. This mod works with both options but for the
optimal experience, you should activate finite water. 

Planned are the following blocks / mechanics:

***Raintank***
Early game rain collection block with a small inventory for water and automating.

***Multiblock Raintank***
This collection will need some more materials and comes as an multiblock. 
It will generate water a bit more quickly and uses the area as multiplier.

***Ground Pump***
This pump need clear sight to bedrock, to get the water from beneath.
It will make use of forge energy.

This mod is in an very early state of development. 
Currently working for Minecraft 1.10.2 but release will be for 1.11.x.
